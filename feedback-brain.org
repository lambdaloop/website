#+TITLE: Feedback: The dark matter of neuroscience

started this as a response to the "sensory processing" view of the rain

(from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09743.pdf)
"Brain computation can be understood as the transformation of representations across stages of process-
ing [1]. Information about the world enters through the senses, is encoded and successively re-coded
so as to extract behaviorally relevant information and transform its representational format to enable the
inferences and decisions needed for successful action"

- feedback is crucial, what is this sensory processing view??

key points
- 90% of neurons going to LGN are feedback
- behavioral effects in V1 in mice
